-> find the smallest i for  x such that phi(i) >= x 
Approach 1 :
	-> we can calculate and store all the phi values and the smallest number for that phi value
	-> problem is  total distinct phi values are <= 2e5 , so it will get TLE
-> for each phi value lets write the smallest number that makes that phi
	-> we can observe that , for each phi , the smallest number that makes that phi is the next larger prime number
