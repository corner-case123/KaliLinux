-> this is a prime example of pure observation , i had no idea how to solve it
	-> so i just printed things
-> first , for each A [10,1e5] i calculated A-B and printed them , it didnot say much
-> then i thought about the simpler version of the problem 
	-> for each A-B find the  number of A 
	-> I found that for each A-B there was at least 1 and at most 2  A 
	-> and there were very few A-B for which the count was 2 
	-> then i got interested about the A-B with count 2 [count of valid A]
	-> for each A-B  having count 2 (valid A) i printed the answers (A1 and A2)
	-> I saw that starting from 18 , each A-B having (A-B) = 18+k*9  had count 2 (valid A)
		-> also A1 = 19 + k*10 and A2 = 20 + k*10
	-> what about A-B with count 1 (valid A) ?
		-> for this I printed all the A-B with their soln (A1,A2)
		-> the I saw the another pattern
		-> the answer was A1" - (n-(a-b)) [where n is the next greater multiple of 9 >(a-b)  and A1" belongs to n1]
