problem A :

-> this is a simple math  problem 
-> if a>=b ans is a 
-> else if b-a > a answer is  0 
-> else ans is a - (b-a)
-> note : eqn is a-x >= b-2*x (x>=b-a) (where x is the amount of depo that we have to make)

problem B :

-> we idea is simple we have two value from which we have taken , also another from which we havenot
-> it is better to pick the value from which we havenot yet taken
-. because we dont know the value of either of them

problem C :

-> n arrays of size 2 , which i have concatenate in such an order that number of inversios are min
-> i got a simple idea , that print the array first that has the lowest value 
-> if they have the same first value then compare the second value (simply use a multiset)
-> but i dont the formal proof of this (tho this is a candidate soln)
