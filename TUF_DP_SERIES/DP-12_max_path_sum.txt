-> this is another grid problem : 
-> here we have find the max path_sum from any cell of the first row to any cell of the last row 
-> from (i,j)  we can move to (i+1,j-1) , (i+1,j) , (i+1,j+1) 
-> def : dp[i][j] = max sum to reach this cell
-> transition : dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j-1],dp[i-1][j],dp[i-1][j+1]) + a[i][j]
