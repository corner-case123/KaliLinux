The Last Ember

The wind howled through the shattered windows of the old cathedral, carrying with it the scent of distant rain and something older—something forgotten. Elias pulled his coat tighter around his shoulders, stepping carefully over the broken stone floor. The candle in his hand flickered, casting restless shadows against the towering columns that stretched toward the heavens.

He shouldn’t have come here. Not alone.

A whisper brushed against his ear—too close, too real. He turned sharply, the candlelight trembling. Nothing but the emptiness of the abandoned ruin. But he knew better. This place was not empty.

Somewhere in the darkness, something moved.

His fingers tightened around the hilt of the old dagger at his belt, its edge dulled by time but still humming with the echoes of its purpose. He had read about this place in his grandfather’s journals—the warnings scribbled in shaking ink, the desperate plea: If you ever find the last ember, do not let it go out.

And now, there it was, at the altar’s edge. A single ember, impossibly bright, hovering above the cold stone. It pulsed as if it had a heartbeat.

Elias stepped forward.

Then he heard the voice. Low, ancient, and laced with something between sorrow and rage.

"You are too late."

The ember flared.

And the darkness swallowed him whole.
