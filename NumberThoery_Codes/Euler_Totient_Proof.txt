The Euler totient function, denoted φ(n), counts the number of integers from 1 to n that are coprime with n. The formula for φ(n) is:

φ(n) = n * Π(1 - 1/p),  
where the product is over all distinct prime divisors p of n.

### Proof:

1. **Basic Idea**:  
   For a positive integer n, φ(n) is the count of integers x (1 ≤ x ≤ n) such that gcd(x, n) = 1.

2. **Case for Prime Numbers**:  
   If n = p (a prime number), all integers 1, 2, ..., p-1 are coprime with p since p has no divisors other than 1 and p.  
   Hence, φ(p) = p - 1.

3. **Prime Powers**:  
   If n = p^e, the integers 1, 2, ..., p^e that are not coprime with p^e are precisely the multiples of p: p, 2p, 3p, ..., p^{e-1}p.  
   There are p^{e-1} such multiples.  
   Thus, the number of integers coprime with p^e is:  
   φ(p^e) = p^e - p^{e-1} = p^e * (1 - 1/p).

4. **General Case**:  
   For n = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} ... p_k^{e_k} (prime factorization of n), the integers not coprime with n are those divisible by at least one prime p_1, p_2, ..., p_k.  

   Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion:  
   - The fraction of integers divisible by p_i is 1/p_i.  
   - The fraction divisible by p_i p_j is 1/(p_i p_j), and so on.

   The fraction of integers not coprime with n is:  
   Sum(1/p_i) - Sum(1/(p_i * p_j)) + ... + (-1)^k / (p_1 * p_2 * ... * p_k).

   The fraction of integers coprime with n is:  
   1 - [Sum(1/p_i) - Sum(1/(p_i * p_j)) + ...].  

   Simplifying, the number of integers coprime with n is:  
   φ(n) = n * Π(1 - 1/p_i),  
   where p_i are the distinct prime factors of n.

### Example:  
For n = 12:  
n = 2^2 * 3, so the prime factors are 2 and 3. Using the formula:  
φ(12) = 12 * (1 - 1/2) * (1 - 1/3)  
       = 12 * (1/2) * (2/3)  
       = 4.  

The numbers coprime with 12 are 1, 5, 7, and 11, which confirms φ(12) = 4.
