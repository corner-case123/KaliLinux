**|**|* with k-1 bars we can distribute n objects into k groups 

-> bars & stars method allows to build up combination 
	-> like we can add a new color or new bar or new star as we want 
	-> its like dp , build a large one on top of a smaller one 
	
	ex : https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/553/A
		-> here first we can only solve for color 1 , then add color 2 , then 3 and so on 
		-> this makes bar & star very powerful

no_of_ways : (n+k-1)C(k-1)  or (n+k-1)Cn  
	idea : we start with total number of objects(n+k-1) 
		from them we select k-1 as bars or n as stars (very sexy way)
		
no of soln of eqn : X1 + X2 + .. + Xk = n   (Xi >= 0 and Xi integer)
	no of soln : (n+k-1)Cn or (n+k-1)C(k-1)
	
	
no of soln of eqn : X1 + X2 + .. + Xk = n   (Xi >= C and Xi integer)
	mod : X1' + X2' + ... + Xn' = n - k*C  (X1'>=0 and X1' integer)
