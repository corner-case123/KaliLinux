-> soln tags :

1) observation : 10
2) logical analysis of problem +  claim/hypothesis/deduction : 29
3) dry-run test cases and look at the findings/problem from diff. angle : 9
4) solve the problem for simpler cases and then solve the actual problem : 4
5) simplify/modify the problem : 5
6) bold claim/intuitive claim (without proof): 3
7) lets say i have a soln &&  what characteristics would it have / working from soln / working backwards : 7
8) similar to past problems : 7
9) formulate the problem-statement / make a proper structure from the statement  : 2
10) solid knowledge/theory : 1 
11) solving by sub-problems/components : 3
12) soln design using DS : 1 
## look at the constraints , conditions and sample cases
  -> can you find any soln idea or observation from sample
  -> do you see any special constraint or condition that can provide  hint or give  idea : 1


tips :
1) sometimes make  some claim like : this loop will not run for long 
2) pure brute-force
3) consider/simulate all the cases before starting to code 
4) dont over-complicate , start from unoptimized , then  go to optimization , not the other way around 
5) check if soln. is hidden in the sample cases !!!!!!!!!

issues :

1)  implementation issue : 4
2) not handling all the cases / missing cases : 3
3) wrong claim / incorrect-analysis : 4
3) improve observation skill :
4) did not make bold claims : 1 
5) too slow : 10
6) give up too early : 1
