-> soln tags :

1) observation : 11
  -> print things and find pattern : 1 
2) logical analysis of problem +  claim/hypothesis/deduction : 43
3) dry-run some cases and look at the findings/problem from diff. angle : 13
4) solve the problem for simpler cases and then solve the actual problem : 5
5) simplify/modify the problem/modify the given equation : 8
6) bold claim/intuitive claim (without proof): 4
7) lets say i have a soln &&  what characteristics would it have / working from soln / working backwards : 7
8) similar to past problems : 9
9) formulate the problem-statement / make a proper structure from the statement  : 3
10) solid knowledge/theory : 2
11) solving by sub-problems/components/different cases(for n%2==0 soln1 and n%2==1 soln2) : 9
12) soln design using DS : 4
## think in a dp manner -> how we transition from one state (choice) to another :  1
  -> this also helps to find proof 
## look at the constraints , conditions and sample cases
  -> can you find any soln idea or observation from sample :  1
  -> do you see any special constraint or condition that can provide  hint or give  idea : 3
## check if it has a monotonic property or not : 6
## deal with the problems first  :  3
  ->lets say i have to minimise some cost 
  -> for this , check which entities affects my minimum cost the most
  -> deal with them first 


tips : ## sometimes there are some important corner cases make sure to handle them
1) sometimes make  some claim like : this loop will not run for long 
2) pure brute-force
3) consider/simulate all the cases before starting to code 
4) dont over-complicate , start from unoptimized , then  go to optimization , not the other way around 
5) check if soln. is hidden in the sample cases !!!!!!!!!

issues :

1)  implementation issue : 4
2) not handling all the cases / missing cases : 4
3) wrong claim / incorrect-analysis : 6
3) improve observation skill :
4) did not make bold claims : 1 
5) too slow / poor attention and focus  : 15
6) give up too early : 1
7) correct idea but wrong way of implementation : 1
