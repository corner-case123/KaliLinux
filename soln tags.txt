-> soln tags :

1) observation : 3
2) logical analysis of problem +  claim/hypothesis/deduction : 14
3) dry-run many cases and look at the data from diff. angle : 1 
4) solve the problem for simpler cases and then solve the actual problem : 3
5) simplify/modify the problem : 2 
6) bold claim/intuitive claim (without proof): 2
7) lets say i have a soln &&  what characteristics would it have / working from soln / working backwards : 2
8) similar to past problems : 2

tips :
1) sometimes make  some claim like : this loop will not run for long 

issues :

1)   implementation issue : 3
2) case handling  && not handling all the cases :
3) wrong claim : 2
3) improve observation skill :
4) did not make bold claims : 1 
5) too slow : 2 
6) give up too early : 1
