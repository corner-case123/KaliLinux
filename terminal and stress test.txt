-> to compile and run a code 
	-> using "cd" go to the folder with .cpp file 
	-> compile : g++ test.cpp -o test
	-> run : ./test 
	-> to read i/p from a file : ./test < input.txt
	-> to write o/p to a file : ./test > output.txt
	-> combine them : ./test < input.txt > output.txt (they must be in the same folder)

-> write a random test-case generator for stress-test
	-> you can adjust the parameters value from script file 
-> write a brute-force naive soln. that you know works for sure 
-> write a script file 
	-> before running give permission with : chmod +x script.sh
	-> that will run your-main code and save the output in  a output file
	-> it will also run the naive-soln (correct) and also save the  output in a  answer file
	-> then it will compare output and answer file , in case it finds any miss match
		-> it will print that case and exit 
		
-> sample testing result 
1
1c1
< 6

> 22

-> first line is the test-case number
-> second line means line 1 of output differs from  line 1 in answer
->  < 6 , means the output is  6 
-> >22 , means the correct soln is 22
